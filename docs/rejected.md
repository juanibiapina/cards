# Resources

## Face down cards

We can use a pile of face down cards to count some resource. It would be annoying to count them while taking care not to reveal or look at them, so this shouldn't be used as a per-player resource. This can perhaps be used to count a global resource, like resources on a planet, for instance.

## Mixed resources cards in a deck

I'm conflicted about having cards which are just "money" or "victory points". Dominion has these as cards, but they need to be separated before the game and you need to take care not to mix them.
  - I could maybe still have resource cards mixed with other kinds of cards, and the choice between them could be a strategic point.
  - If you don't find a card that you like, you could pick up resources
  - How do we prevent players from drawing resources? Is this even a bad thing? Because actually if you get a lot of resources in your starting hand, maybe you could buy a strong card right then.

## Cards themselves (1 resource point per card like RftG)

This screws up the cards you buy. Since I predict this not to be very fun, I won't use this idea for now. Race for the galaxy makes this work because cards come from the global deck, not a personal one.

## Face down cards for counting mana only

This works like hearthstone. You'd get one mana per turn, and you'd only need to tap the cards. Everyone would then get the same number of this resource initially (1 mana per turn, for instance).

This can be used as a resource to play cards, but hardly to buy them.
