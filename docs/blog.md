# Thinking about power combinations

Today I created a few cards. I was trying to come up specifically with mechanics that involve two different powers.

For instance, what could be a card that mixes Military and Trade? How about Military and Diplomacy?

How about the three Powers together?

This was a fun exercise, but in the end I only came with 5 or 6 cards. I'd like to have a lot more of these multi power cards in the third prototype.

I've also written down all areas in the game where cards can be, turns phases and actions that players can take.
