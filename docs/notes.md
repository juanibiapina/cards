# General

The idea is to create a deck building game which is strategic, fun and refreshing.

# Restrictions

- Only one deck of cards
- No player elimination
- No props or pieces or boards
- Can't start with a fixed hand (requires card separation)

# Ideas

- Have alternating parts (like XCOM) to create a sense of refreshment
- Draft the initial hand of cards
  - Like Magic
- Allow trading
- Allow selling cards
  - Other players can then buy sold cards
- Shared card pool from which players can buy and sell to
  - Like a Magic store
- In game bets
  - Awards like Mars
  - Win cards from others
- Rows of units on the board and cards that affect them
- Use cards to count resources
  - Mana
  - Gold
  - Life
- Affect other player's games
  - A lot like magic
  - Unlike Terraforming Mars
- Acquire a Personal power (why?)
  - Corporations in Terraforming Mars
  - Hero in Hearthstone
  - Starting planet in RftG
