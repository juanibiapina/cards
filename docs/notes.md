# General

The idea is to create a deck building game which is strategic, fun and refreshing.

# Restrictions

- Only one deck of cards
- No player elimination
- No props or pieces or boards
- Can't start with a fixed hand (requires card separation)

# Resource Ideas

- Your deck
- Cards themselves (this means more cards, more playing power)
  - From your hand
  - From the top of your deck
  - Anything that makes better use of cards is powerful
    - What's the counter point?
- Gold (extra cards (or pieces))
- Mana (same number of resources for everyone)

# Ideas

- Have alternating parts (like XCOM) to create a sense of refreshment
- Draft the initial hand of cards
  - Like Magic
- Allow trading
- Allow selling cards
  - Other players can then buy sold cards
- Shared card pool from which players can buy and sell to
  - Like a Magic store in real life
- In game bets
  - Awards like Mars
  - Win cards from others
- Rows of units on the board and cards that affect them
- Affect other player's games
  - A lot like magic
  - Unlike Terraforming Mars
- Acquire a Personal power (why?)
  - Corporations in Terraforming Mars
  - Hero in Hearthstone
  - Starting planet in RftG

# Open questions

- What is the theme?
- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of Dominion
- How do you win?
  - Is this connected to the theme?

# Gameplay

## With Rounds and Turns

- What's the objective of a round?
- At the end of a round you decide what cards to buy or sell
- What to use as money ? How do you get it ?
- When does a round end
  - If there's an expensable resource, like Mars, you can just wait for people to pass
  - If it goes until people's decks are exausted, someone can hack their decks to never stop playing

Gameplay happens in rounds. Rounds are played in turns. Each player takes a
turn and then passes to the next one.

On the beginning of a round, each player shuffles their decks and draws 5 cards.

On each turn:
  - Draw a card
  - Play one card from your hand

After a round is over, move on to
  - Buy a card from the Store paying its buying cost
  - Sell a card to the Store and get money ?

After the shopping phase, remove all cards from the table and start a new round.

## Continuous

- This would be like dominion then, where you'd just start over every turn
- Maybe elements of base building, since things can persist between games
