# General

The idea is to create a deck building game which is strategic, fun and refreshing.

# Restrictions

- Only one deck of cards
- No player elimination
- No props or pieces or boards
- Simple setup
  - Can't start with a fixed hand (requires card separation during setup)

# Lore

Fleet commanders exploring space.

With the remnants of your empire, you make a faster-than-light jump to a new galaxy. You compete for extracting resources from this galaxy. Then you improve your fleet and jump to the next galaxy and competition continues.

# Resources

- In the beginning it's more important to build an economy. Later in the game you use your money to acquire victory points. There should be no rewards for investing in economy in the late game.
  - This requires some vision of what the late game is.

## The Deck

In a deck building game, your deck is your main "resource". It would make sense then, that everything that you can do comes out of it. Even your resources or victory points. This is similar to Dominion.

## Counters

Counters on top of cards add a bunch of dynamic information. It allows us to damage units without destroying them, creating resources every turn, converting them into actions, etc. Might be a great thing to allow the Trade power.

# Ideas

- Draft the initial hand of cards
  - Like Magic
- Allow trading
- Allow selling cards
  - Other players can then buy sold cards
- Shared card pool from which players can buy and sell to
  - Like a Magic store in real life
- In game bets
  - Awards like Mars
  - Win cards from others
- Rows of units on the board and cards that affect them
- Affect other player's games
  - A lot like magic
  - Unlike Terraforming Mars
- Acquire a Personal power (why?)
  - Corporations in Terraforming Mars
  - Hero in Hearthstone
  - Starting planet in RftG

# Open questions

- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of Dominion
  - Disadvantages
    - Annoying setup
- How do you win?
  - Is this connected to the theme?
  - Victory points seems to be a good choice because points can be tuned to make the game more balanced

# Gameplay

## With Rounds and Turns

### Possible Rounds

Galaxies have resources. These resources can be acquired in different ways. When all players pass, the round ends. The next round goes in order of who passes first.

Ways to acquire resources:
  - Military
  - Diplomacy
  - Harvesting

### Open questions

- What's the objective of a round?
  - Rounds with different objectives?
  - How to do objectives with only one deck of cards ?
    - Fixed objective (every round has a fixed number of resources)
- Who wins the round?
  - It should be influenced by players
  - A player might get an advantage from ending the round faster and having more rounds
    - Because he gets bonuses on round start or end
    - Because they have cards which get stronger the more rounds you have
    - Because they have cards which transition well into the next round
  - When you cause a lot of damage to something
    - People with creatures can do more damage per turn
    - People without creatures can try to stall the game

### Flow

Gameplay happens in rounds. Rounds are played in turns. Each player takes a
turn and then passes to the next one.

On the beginning of a round, each player shuffles their decks and draws 5 cards.

Place the galaxy cards in the center. Twice the number of players.

On each turn you can either:
  - Draw a card
  - Deploy
  - Explore
  - Pass

When everyone passes, shuffle all your cards into your deck and start a new round.
